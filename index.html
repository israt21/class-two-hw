            Scholastica is one of the largest private English-medium schools in Bangladesh, offering pre-school to A' Level classes of an international standard. It offers a complete school-leaving course using English as the medium of instruction. We emphasize equal proficiency in Bangla as a necessary prerequisite for a well-rounded education for Bangladeshi students. Scholastica's curriculum has been designed to reflect the specific needs of Bangladeshi students keeping in mind their heritage, culture and national identity. The school has designed a comprehensive curriculum for all classes leading to the University of Cambridge International Examinations Ordinary and Advanced Level General Certificate of Education courses which are taught in Classes IX to XII. These examinations are administered by the British Council, Dhaka.  In the Junior school, we encourage children to observe their surroundings, think independently, ask questions and to freely express themselves. In recent years, we have introduced center-based classrooms, where diverse activities are conducted to develop a range of important skills
